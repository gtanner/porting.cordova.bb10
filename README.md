# Assembling the PhoneGap BlackBerry 10 Workshop

This is a do-it-yourself, hands-on, gritty session where we will 
assemble and use the tools for building a PhoneGap BlackBerry 10 
application. There will sweat, grease, and digital sawdust across 
the stage, as members of the BlackBerry and PhoneGap team download, 
install, and setup the development environment. Once finished, 
the team will present a clean workbench of discrete tools for 
building, polishing, and refining your handcrafted BlackBerry 
10 web application.
