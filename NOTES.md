# Presenter Notes

# Opening:

I vote we just show the "slidedeck" without talking, about 5 seconds per slide, might be a fun way to introduce
the talk

# Things to show:

Ideally we should show the steps needed to build apps for OS7, PlayBook and BB10.  I think we can be safe to assume
that they have set up the signing keys, SDKs and such to build on their computer for each of those platforms.

With that baseline assumption we can start from www.phonegap.com and download from there.

- Create a project for BlackBerry
- Update the project.properties
- Build and deploy on all 3 platforms
  - Should be fine just showing the "hello world app"
- How to enable remote web inspector
- How to setup your webworks app to point to another server (will only do this on BB10 as it is the same for all platforms)
- Show mobile spec as the "real" sample app
- load the same app on Android (would be cool to show the "cross platform" idea).  We can show build.phonegap.com for this
  so we don't need to have the android SDK setup on a machine.

# Ideas

I could see this talk not lasting a full hour, would be cool if after 30 mins or so we just open up the
floor and go down into the audience to setup their laptops.  Could really suck but could also work really well

# Needed:

- USB Key with phonegap download (Mike will provide)
- Laptop setup with all BlackBerry SDK's (Gord's laptop can do this ;))
- PlayBook (Gord can provide)
- DevAlpha (Gord can provide)
- OS7 device (Gord can provide)
- Android device (Fil can provide)
- Beer (RIM should provide)
